IT  is  twenty  years  since  I  first  determined  to  attempt  the
translation  of  Faust,  in  the  original  metres.  At  that  time,
although  more  than  a  score  of  English  translations  of  the
First  Part,  and  three  or  four  of  the  Second  Part,  were  in
existence,  the  experiment  had  not  yet  been  made.  The  prose
version  of  Ha5rward  seemed  to  have  been  accepted  as  the
standard,  in  default  of  anything  more  satisfactory:  the  English
critics,  generally  sustaining  the  translator  in  his  views  con-
cerning the  secondary  importance  of  form  in  Poetry,  practi-
cally discouraged  any  further  attempt ;  and  no  one,  familiar
with  rhythmical  expression  through  the  needs  of  his  own
nature,  had  devoted  the  necessary  love  and  patience  to  an
adequate  reproduction  of  the  great  work  of  Goethe's  life.

Mr.  Brooks  was  the  first  to  undertake  the  task,  and  the
pubhcation  of  his  translation  of  the  First  Part  (in  1856)
induced  me,  for  a  time,  to  give  up  my  own  design.  No
previous  English  version  exhibited  such  abnegation  of  the
translator's  own  tastes  and  habits  of  thought,  such  reverent
desire  to  present  the  original  in  its  purest  form.  The  care
and  conscience  with  which  the  work  had  been  performed
were  so  apparent,  that  I  now  state  with  reluctance  what  then
seemed  to  me  to  be  its  only  deficiencies, â€” a  lack  of  the  lyrical
fire  and  fluency  of  the  original  in  some  passages,  and  an
occasional  lowering  of  the  tone  through  the  use  of  words  which
are  literal,  but  not  equivalent.  The  plan  of  translation
adopted  by  Mr.  Brooks  was  so  entirely  my  own,  that  when
further  residence  in  Germany  and  a  more  careful  study  of
both  parts  of  Faust  had  satisfied  me  that  the  field  was  still
